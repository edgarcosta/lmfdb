Process for making png images of group names for subgroup diagrams:

 - run dump-pretty.py  It produces eqguts.tex which has the latex and prettyindex to 
   be uploaded to the db

 - copy eqguts and eq.tex to a machine with latex and dvipng

 - latex eq.tex

 - run dvipng -bg Transparent eq.dvi

 - tar up the pngs with ./mytar (also on that machine)

 - cp alleqns.tar back to legendre

 - untar it into the images directory

 - run load-img.py
